## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark, desaturated blue-gray (#22272D) to create a professional dark mode base.
- Primary color: Subtle teal (#73C2FB) to provide modern, yet non-distracting highlights.
- Accent color: Light desaturated cyan (#B0E2FF) for interactive elements and emphasis, analogous to the primary.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a neutral, objective look, is ideal for a professional, readable portfolio. Using it for all body and headlines gives a clean, minimalist appearance.
- Employ a minimalist design focusing on spacing and readability. Content should be well-organized and easy to navigate.
- Use a set of simple line icons for navigation and interactive elements, in the accent color.
- Subtle, fade-in animations on page load and transitions between sections to add polish without being distracting.
