## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light gray or white (e.g., #FFFFFF or #F0F0F0) to create a clean and bright base.
- Primary color: A calming and professional color (e.g., a moderate blue like #007BFF) for highlights and primary elements.
- Accent color: A slightly different shade or a complementary color (e.g., a lighter blue or a subtle green like #28A745) for interactive elements and emphasis.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a neutral, objective look, is ideal for a professional, readable portfolio. Using it for all body and headlines gives a clean, minimalist appearance.
- Employ a minimalist design focusing on spacing and readability. Content should be well-organized and easy to navigate.
- Use a set of simple line icons for navigation and interactive elements, in the accent color.
- Subtle, fade-in animations on page load and transitions between sections to add polish without being distracting.
